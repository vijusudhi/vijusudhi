## Hi, I'm Viju Sudhi 👋

I’m a Research Associate and PhD Student in the [Semantic Computing group](https://www.semantic-computing.de/) (since July 2025), currently working on the **LLM4KMU** project — developing Smaller Language Models (SLMs) tailored for Small and Medium Enterprises.

If you find common research interests, I am always happy to collaborate! 😊
